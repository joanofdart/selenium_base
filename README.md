# About

Simple script which has the following functionalities:

* Signs in to [WriteAs](https://write.as)
* Creates a post
* Edits the latest created post
* Deletes the latest created post

# Running the tests

* Simply run ``pytest`` and watch the magic happen.

# Why

Did this for fun and to learn about [SeleniumBase](https://seleniumbase.io), in my opinion, lacks a lot of documentation
